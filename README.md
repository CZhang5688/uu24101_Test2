# uu24101_Test2

# Git Usage
## Main Branch
The main branch contains all functional code, and can be used to as the most up-to-date functional version of this code base.

## Testing Branch
This branch is where I did tests on new code / changes to ensure they're functional before pulling them and committing them to the main branch. 


# Main Modifications
## 1. Recreating the header files. 
Firstly, I recreated the missing system.h and disk.h files, recreating them exactly using the documentation provided by the "refman.pdf" file.

## 2. Updated the main.cpp and system.cpp files to add the missing include statements. 
Updated the main.cpp with the missing "include system.h" that was required, as suggested by the hint given. 

## 3. system.cpp member function class
Completed the hint that required providing a definition for a member function of the system class called uniform.

## 4. disk.cpp calculation method
Completed the calculation method for calculating distance between disk and other disk.
